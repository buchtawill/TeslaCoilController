IMPORTANT MIDI NOTES

The controller does not support midi events other than note on and note off. Delete all other events at the beginning of a file,
for example, "Text" or "Program change"

MIDI File requirements:
 - Only on and off events - no program control change or tempo change
 - Maximum of 4 notes at any given time
 - Generally, 1 note per track
 - track 0 and 1 correspond to coil A, track 2 and 3 correspond to coil B
 - Track 0 and track 2 can have 2 notes each, as long as there are no notes on tracks 1 and 3.
 + i.e. If track 0 is playing 2 notes, one of the notes will be automatically bumped down to track 1 by software
 - Maximum frequency: Try to stay at C6 or below
 - No notes inside notes: I.E. if a note is playing on track 0, the same note cannot start again before it finishes

 - underworld
 - dual smbtheme
 - south park theme
