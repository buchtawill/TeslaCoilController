MAIN BOARD
-----------------------------------
 Progress
 - All shift registers have 5V
 - All 3v3 pins on STM32 have power
 - No shorts
 
 Next Steps
 - Cycle numbers thru all 7-seg displays, measure current draw




DAUGHTER BOARD A - Bus voltage: 350V / 175V per
-----------------------------------
 - 5V buck working
 - ADP1:  working
 - ADP2:  working
 - ADPST: working
 - All regulators installed and functioning
 - Successfully ran a debug application

Unpopulated:
 - R1: 1M
 - R2: 16.2k
 
TODO:
 - C16, C20: Fix ground
 - R3 / R4: Populate R4 with resistor
 - R5: Populate with 100k resistor


DAUGHTER BOARD B - Bus voltage: 400V max
-----------------------------------
 - 5v buck working
 - ADP1:  No short with 3v3 directly in. LED good
 - ADP2:  working
 - ADPST: No short with 3v3 directly in. LED good 
 - All regulators installed and functioning
 - Successfully ran a debug application

R1: 1M
R2: 16.2k



Temp board B has a weird bug where it can only initialize after being powered on - resetting 
will cause execution to hang on uwTickPrio at 0x20000004
